    <strong>Network-wide ad blocking via your own Linux hardware</strong>
</p>


### What is Pi-hole?
Pi-hole is free and open-source software that works as a network-wide ad blocker, acting as a DNS sinkhole to block unwanted content. It improves privacy and speeds up browsing by preventing ads and trackers.

### What are the benefits of Pi-hole?
Here are the key benefits of Pi-hole:
- **DNS Server** Use Pi-hole as your DNS server.
- **Ad Blocking**: Blocks ads at the network level, preventing them from loading on any device connected to your network.
- **Privacy Protection**: Reduces tracking by blocking third-party cookies, analytics, and tracking domains.
- **Faster Browsing**: Speeds up page load times by preventing ads and unnecessary content from loading.
- **Network-wide Coverage**: Blocks ads across all devices (smartphones, computers, smart TVs, etc.) without needing individual app configurations.
- **Reduced Bandwidth Usage**: Less data is consumed since ads and unwanted content are blocked before being downloaded.
- **Customizable Filters**: Allows you to add custom blocklists or allow specific domains to suit your needs.
- **Enhanced Security**: Can block malicious domains, protecting your network from malware and phishing attempts.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation on a Raspberry Pi or other devices, with a user-friendly web interface for management.
- **Free and Open Source**: No cost and open for community contributions and improvements.

### **Who can use it?**  
Anyone with a home or business network can use Pi-hole, particularly those looking to enhance privacy or reduce internet clutter.

### **Why it must be in everyone's system or server**  
Pi-hole offers improved security, faster browsing, and a cleaner, ad-free experience for all devices connected to the network.

### **System Requirements**  
Pi-hole runs on devices like Raspberry Pi, Linux servers, or virtual machines with minimal resources (256MB RAM, 2GB storage).
